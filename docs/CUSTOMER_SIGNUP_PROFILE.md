# Customer Signup - Profile, Roles & Visibility

## Overview

When a customer signs up on Saree4Ever, they receive a user account with specific profile data, role permissions, and visibility settings. This document explains what customers get upon registration.

## Signup Process

### What Happens During Signup

1. **Supabase Authentication**
   - User account created in `auth.users` table (Supabase managed)
   - Email and password stored securely
   - User receives email verification (if enabled)

2. **User Profile Creation**
   - Profile record created in `user_profiles` table
   - Profile includes:
     - `id` (UUID, matches auth.users.id)
     - `full_name` (optional, from signup form)
     - `phone` (optional, from signup form)
     - `created_at` (timestamp)

3. **JWT Token Generation**
   - Backend generates JWT token with:
     - `id`: User UUID
     - `email`: User email
     - `role`: `'user'` (default customer role)
   - Token expires in 7 days

## Customer Profile Structure

### Database Schema

```sql
-- user_profiles table
{
  id: UUID (primary key, references auth.users.id),
  full_name: VARCHAR (nullable),
  phone: VARCHAR (nullable),
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```
